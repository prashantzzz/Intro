# Prashant
An Information Technology B-Tech undergrad at VIT Vellore.
I'm into programming and graphic designing. In my free time, I like to practice on coding websites like  HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/prashantzz)/GFG(https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/prashantzz) or prefer designing some posters or thumbnails on Photoshop/Canva. I have a knack for grasping new skills. 

# Projects
I have built a voice controlled chatbot windows application using python only(find it here: bit.ly/pAssist). 
I'm currently on DSA.
I have created many GUI Software using Python language including Voice Assistant, Calculator, Text chat interface, Resume maker etc. I am proficient in managing databases using either MySQL solely or with it's python integration.

Created MateFlix, a website for the hostellers that solved the hectic task of finding a suitable roommate in college.
Having features to sort by year, programme with an add option to contact any of the sorted hostellers in search of a roommate.
